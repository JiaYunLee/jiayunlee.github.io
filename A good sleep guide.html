	<h1>A good sleep guide</h1>
	<p id = "small">Source：Pragmatic Thinking</p>
	<hr>
	<p>World Sleep Day is upon us. That’s right, we’ve circled the sun once more and the calendar has ticked over to what is, for many of us, an opportunity to feel vaguely shamed by how little quality sleep we are getting. Woo-bloody-hoo, right?</p>
	<p>Okay, in reality, this is probably the first time you’ve heard about World Sleep Day. While this hurts my feelings a little bit, because it’s my second favorite day of the year, I’ll live.</p>
	<p>This article isn’t about shaming how much sleep you do or don’t get, or giving you a flaming for how low down the totem pole of priorities a good night of rest falls for you. This is a simple, yet practical, guide to better sleep for everyone ranging from parents with young children to under-the-pump-professionals.</p>

	<h2>So, what is World Sleep Day?</h2>
	<p>World Sleep Day is a mark on the calendar with the purpose of bringing to light how important sleep is, the dangers of not getting enough sleep, and how sleep deprived we are as a society.</p>
	<p>In the words of the World Sleep Society, “World Sleep Day is an annual event, intended to be a celebration of sleep and a call-to-action on important issues related to sleep, including medicine, education, social aspects and driving.”</p>
	<p>Simply put, it’s an opportunity to have a good yarn about sleep, and how as a collective we can do better.</p>

	<h2>What is the research saying about sleep?</h2>
	<p>To be honest, recent research around sleep is pretty dire. It’s showing that as the world gets fastter and more technological, our natural sleep patterns are becoming more and more disrupted.</p>
	<p>In 2020 we are, as a society, not getting enough sleep. When you consider the sleep we do get, it’s often of compromised quality.</p>
	<p>While it may seem that being a bit sleepy isn’t so bad, studies are showing that getting less than a minimum of 7 hours of sleep per night over the short-term leads to the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Decreased cognitive performance (including memory, concentration, problem-solving and decision making.</li>
		<li>Reduction in cardiovascular capacity (potentially to the tune of a 30% reduction).</li>
		<li>Weight gain and difficulty in building lean muscle mass.
	</ul>
	<p>In a nutshell, getting less than 7 hours sleep a night leads to an immediate and dramatic reduction in overall performance.</p>
	<p>A question I pose to leaders when I run workplace performance programs is, ‘How much better off would you be with an extra hour sleep, and a 20-30% increase of performance because of it?’.</p>
	<p>So, there are the immediate effects, now let’s take a look at what the research suggests are the long-term impacts of compromised sleep:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Increased risk of cardiovascular health issues (potentially doubled).</li>
		<li>Shorter life expectancy.</li>
		<li>Increased risk of degenerative cognitive disorders.  </li>
		<li>Lower immune function (more risk of general sickness and ill-health).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Scary stuff, right? While it is pretty frightening to see it laid out like this, my intent isn’t to make you lose sleep over it (haha).</p>
	<p>While the dangers of poor sleep are significant (and in my opinion not to be ignored), for most of us the path to better sleep needn’t be a long or complicated one. In fact, by following this guide, you’ll have a phenomenal chance of levelling-up your sleeping skills, starting tonight.</p>
	<p>There were some pretty serious claims in those bullet points. If you want to dig a little deeper and check out the research sitting behind them, have a read of Mathew Walker’s book ‘Why We Sleep’. There you will find more detail and referencing than I could ever achieve here, and it’s a bloody good read.</p>

	<h2>The Good Sleep Guide</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Step 1: When you wake up, practice gratitude</li>
		<li>Step 2: 2-3 hours before bed, wrap up exercising and eating larger meals.</li>
		<li>Step 3: Avoid booze before you snooze.</li>
		<li>Step 4: Schedule your sleep.</li>
		<li>Step 5: 1 hour before sleep, ditch the screen(s).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
	<p>I’ve given you a lot of information in the form of handy tips. Hopefully, you are feeling empowered and energised. I’d understand, however, if you were feeling a touch overwhelmed by how much sleepy goodness there is to digest in this article.</p>
	<p>My recommendation (as always) is to pick the one, or maybe two strategies that you feel are going to give you the most leverage over your sleep. Put them into practice tonight. </p>
	<p>Chances are putting even one of these tips into practice will cause some disruption to your nightly routine, so if you. don’t 100% nail your chosen tip the first time, don’t sweat it. Go in with the intention of creating better sleep hygiene for yourself, learn from the experience, and go again tomorrow.</p>  
	<p>Your future well-rested self will thank you for it.</p>
